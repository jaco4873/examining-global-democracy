## Scoring Democracy On Various Parameters

Scoring democracy amongst other parameters on pr adult GDP and income inequality in European countries in 2021.
Perhaps scoring is a sum of weighted averages.
Visualisation could be barplot or index.

## Democracy and Economic development
Use data on economic indicators such as GDP and income inequality, as well as data on political institutions and measures of democracy, to explore the relationship between democracy and economic development.

1. The project aims to investigate the relationship between democracy and economic development.
2. Use open data sources such as the World Bank's World Development Indicators or the Freedom House dataset to analyze measures of political rights, civil liberties, and economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates.
3. Use R to create scatterplots and regression models that investigate the relationship between measures of democracy and economic outcomes such as GDP growth rates or levels of foreign direct investment.
4. Use R to perform cluster analysis to identify groups of countries that share similar characteristics in terms of their democratic institutions and economic outcomes.
