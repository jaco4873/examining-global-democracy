## Scoring Democracy On Various Parameters

Perhaps scoring is a sum of weighted averages.
Visualisation could be barplot or index.

Tried to add data, but couldn't support .csv file type.

## Democracy and Economic development
Use data on economic indicators such as GDP and income inequality, as well as data on political institutions and measures of democracy, to explore the relationship between democracy and economic development.

1. The project aims to investigate the relationship between democracy and economic development.
2. Use open data sources such as the World Bank's World Development Indicators or the Freedom House dataset to analyze measures of political rights, civil liberties, and economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates.
3. Use R to create scatterplots and regression models that investigate the relationship between measures of democracy and economic outcomes such as GDP growth rates or levels of foreign direct investment.
4. Use R to perform cluster analysis to identify groups of countries that share similar characteristics in terms of their democratic institutions and economic outcomes. This can help identify patterns and trends in the data that may not be immediately apparent from looking at individual countries or variables. For example, cluster analysis may identify groups of countries with similar levels of democracy and economic growth, or it may reveal differences in economic outcomes between countries with similar levels of democracy.

### Measures of democracy
1.  Electoral integrity (Electoral Integrity Project, which provides a global dataset of election quality indicators)
2. Civil liberties (Freedom House Index, which provides a global ranking of countries based on their level of political rights and civil liberties)
3. Rule of law (World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, which provides a global ranking of countries based on their adherence to the rule of law.)
4. Political accountability (Varieties of Democracy project, which provides a global dataset of political accountability indicators.)
5. The Democracy Score (Index from German homepage)

## Democracy and Social Inequality
Danalyze data on social indicators such as education and health outcomes, as well as measures of democratic institutions, to explore the relationship between democracy and social inequality. Use R to create visualizations that highlight differences in democratic outcomes across countries with varying levels of social inequality.
