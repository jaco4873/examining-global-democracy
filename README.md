# Applied Social Science
2023 Project in Applied Cognitive Science
The Project is an Exploratory Study and WILL need a confirmatory study later on to prove its findings in any way. (Refer to Art of Statistics p. 350-353)
Can we use our model on test-data (which we have not looked into beforehand?), to do some confirmatory experiment?

## Our User story
1. As a researcher, I want to develop a tool that can assist policymakers in making informed decisions regarding improvement of liberal democracy. 
2. As a policymaker, I want a tool to help me improve the democracy in my sphere of authority. I want a tool in which I can test different parameters and their effect on the democracy.

Who? - Policymakers as a first beneficiary of our project. Secondarily could be available for further research.

What? - A regression model, regressing the freedom house score on various macroeconomic scores.

Why? - We believe that freedom in the World operates from the assumption that freedom for all people is best achieved in liberal democratic societies.

## Acceptable products
### MVP
Our Minimal Viable Product is a regression of the Freedom House dataset scores on various macroeconomic scores and relevant data visualisation.

### IP
Our Intermediate Product is the creation of a Github Pages site on which we publish our findings

### AP
Our Advanced Product is self-critique as well as suggesting further studies. This will also be published on Github Pages.


# EXAM TEMPLATE

## Abstract

## Introduction
- A resource to investigate the relationship between democracy and economic variables (by providing codebase)
- A benchmark model, which will be tested when new data is released on the databank
- A challenge to others to create models with a higher predictions rate

## Methodology

- Variables chosen and why
- Modelling choice

## Codebase
- Democracy Index comparison script
- Missing data script
- Data cleaning scripts
- dirty_cat merging script
- Model script 
  - Assumption checking (collinearity)

## Database
- Links
- Names of worldbank series

## Unanswered questions and future work
- Challenges: Causality

## Conclusions
