# Applied Social Science
2023 Project in Applied Cognitive Science


## Our User story
1. As a researcher, I want to develop a tool that can assist policymakers in making informed decisions regarding improvement of liberal democracy. 
2. As a policymaker, I want a tool to help me improve the democracy in my sphere of authority. I want a tool in which I can test different parameters and their effect on the democracy.

Who? - Policymakers as a first beneficiary of our project. Secondarily could be available for further research.

What? - A regression model, regressing the freedom house score on various macroeconomic scores.

Why? - We believe that freedom in the World operates from the assumption that freedom for all people is best achieved in liberal democratic societies.
