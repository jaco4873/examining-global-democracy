# Applied Social Science
2023 Project in Applied Cognitive Science

## Repository Overview
In this repo you will find all data needed to replicate or reproduce our research. A short description of the files and folders follow:

1. codebase.md: this is the markdown document that contains all code needed to get the results included in our article
2. data: in this folder you will find the three data sets we have used in our research
3. resources: in this folder you will find some of the research papers we have during our project
4. archived code: here you will find code snippets: a stand-alone missing data function for World Data Bank, python code for 'fuzzy' merging datasets in Python (alternative to fedmatch), and code for individual assumption checking

## Our User story
1. As a researcher, I want to develop a tool that can assist policymakers in making informed decisions regarding improvement of liberal democracy. 
2. As a policymaker, I want a tool to help me improve the democracy in my sphere of authority. I want a tool in which I can test different parameters and their effect on the democracy.

Who? - Policymakers as a first beneficiary of our project. Secondarily could be available for further research.

What? - A regression model, regressing the freedom house score on various macroeconomic scores.

Why? - We believe that freedom in the World operates from the assumption that freedom for all people is best achieved in liberal democratic societies.

## Acceptable products
### MVP
Our Minimal Viable Product is a regression of the Freedom House dataset scores on various macroeconomic scores and relevant data visualisation.

### IP
Our Intermediate Product is the creation of a Github Pages site on which we publish our findings

### AP
Our Advanced Product is self-critique as well as suggesting further studies. This will also be published on Github Pages.
