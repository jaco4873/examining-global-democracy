# Panel data regression

## Definition of Panel Data
Panel data, also known as longitudinal data, refers to data that are collected over time on a group of individuals or entities. In other words, panel data consist of multiple observations on the same variables for the same individuals or entities over time.

## Use of Panel Data
Use: Panel data are often used in applied research to analyze the effects of policy changes, economic shocks, and other events over time. Panel data can also be used to estimate the effects of individual-level variables on outcomes of interest, while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across individuals

    Def: Unobserved heterogeneity across entities refers to differences among individuals or entities that are not directly observed or measured by the researcher but that may influence the outcome of interest. These differences can affect the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, leading to biased estimates in statistical models. 
    
    For example, consider a study that aims to estimate the effect of education on earnings using a cross-sectional dataset. The study might find a positive relationship between education and earnings, suggesting that more education leads to higher earnings. However, this relationship might be confounded by unobserved heterogeneity across individuals, such as differences in ability, motivation, or family background. These factors can influence both education and earnings, leading to biased estimates of the relationship between the two variables.

## Challanges mitigated by panel data regression models
Unobserved heterogeneity can be particularly problematic in cross-sectional datasets, where differences across individuals or entities may not be captured by the available variables. However, panel data can help mitigate this problem by allowing the researcher to control for time-invariant heterogeneity across individuals or entities using fixed-effects or random-effects models.

    Time-invariant heterogeneity refers to differences among individuals or entities that do not change over time. In other words, time-invariant heterogeneity refers to individual-level characteristics that are constant over the period of observation.
    In our case, that it things such a geographical location, ethnicity, etc.

    Time-invariant heterogeneity can pose a problem for statistical analysis because it can create biases in estimates of the effects of other variables. This is because time-invariant heterogeneity is correlated with both the independent variable of interest and the dependent variable.

    One way to control for time-invariant heterogeneity is to use fixed-effects models in panel data regression analysis. Fixed-effects models estimate the effect of the independent variable by comparing the change in the dependent variable within each individual over time.

## Fixed or Mixed effect model?
Fixed effects models are appropriate when the focus is on within-entity variation over time, and when there is no interest in estimating the effects of time-invariant variables. Mixed effects models are appropriate when there is interest in estimating the effects of both time-varying and time-invariant variables, and when the effects of the time-invariant variables are expected to vary across entities.

In some cases, researchers might combine fixed effects and mixed effects models to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships among the variables of interest. This approach, known as a hybrid model, includes both fixed and random effects in the model and allows for estimation of the effects of time-varying and time-invariant variables while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across entities.

## Project relevance
the FW data from 2013 to 2022 is panel data. We can append that dataframe with macroeconomic variables and create a mixed effect model regression.
-  We can focus on a selection of countries

Time-invariant factors:
factors such as geography, language, culture, history, and institutional structures are often considered time-invariant in cross-country analyses of democracy and economic development

By including the "country_i" and "year_t" variables in the model, we can estimate the impact of the macroeconomic variables on the liberal democracy score while accounting for any country-specific or time-specific factors that may affect the relationship. This is known as a panel data regression, which is a more appropriate approach for analyzing panel data than a simple linear regression.


### FIXED EFFECT Model Suggestion
LiberalDemScore_it = β0 + β1GDPperCapita_it + β2GiniCoeff_it + β3Education_it + β4EmploymentRate_it + β5GrowthRate_it + β6InflationRate_it + β7*PovertyRate_it + country_i + year_t + e_it

where:

LiberalDemScore_it is the liberal democracy score for country i in year t
GDPperCapita_it is the GDP per capita for country i in year t
GiniCoeff_it is the Gini coefficient for country i in year t
Education_it is the education level for country i in year t
EmploymentRate_it is the employment rate for country i in year t
GrowthRate_it is the growth rate for country i in year t
InflationRate_it is the inflation rate for country i in year t
PovertyRate_it is the poverty rate for country i in year t
country_i are the country fixed effects
year_t are the year fixed effects
e_it is the error term



To include the fixed effects, you could include a set of dummy variables in the model that indicate which country each observation belongs to. This would control for any time-invariant factors that are unique to each country, such as historical or cultural factors. ( AS ABOVE)

### MIXED EFFECT Model Suggestion
To include the random effects, you could assume that the effect of each independent variable on the democracy score varies randomly across countries. For example, you could include a random slope for each independent variable, which would allow the effect of each independent variable to vary across countries while still controlling for the effects of country-specific factors.

#### LONG FORMAT
To include random effects in the model, we assume that the coefficients of the independent variables vary across countries. Specifically, we assume that the coefficients follow a normal distribution with a mean and variance. This means that the effect of each independent variable on the liberal democracy score will vary randomly across countries according to a normal distribution.

For example, let's say we have a model with two independent variables: GDP per capita and education level. We can include random effects by allowing the coefficients for each independent variable to vary randomly across countries. This means that the effect of GDP per capita on the liberal democracy score will vary randomly across countries, and the effect of education level on the liberal democracy score will also vary randomly across countries.

To be more specific, we would estimate a separate coefficient for each independent variable for each country. These coefficients would be drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and variance. The mean would represent the average effect of the independent variable across all countries, and the variance would represent the degree of variation in the effect of the independent variable across countries.

By including random effects in the model, we can account for unobserved country-specific factors that may affect the relationship between the independent variables and the liberal democracy score. This can lead to more accurate estimates of the effects of the independent variables on the liberal democracy score.


## Causal effects?
If prior research has suggested a causal relationship between GDP per capita and democracy score, and if the panel data regression finds a significant positive relationship between the two variables while controlling for other factors, then it is reasonable to suggest that changes in GDP per capita causally impact the democracy score. However, the causal inference should still be made cautiously and with recognition of the limitations of the model.

It is also important to note that while panel data regression can help identify associations between variables, it cannot establish causality on its own. Causal inference requires a combination of statistical analysis, theory, and additional evidence.
